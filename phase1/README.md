CSC207 Project 

Amir Azimi, Jeffrey Huang, Arjun Pandher, Junhee Jung, Qinyu Wu, Carl Wu, Jinesh Patel, Yilong You

Notes:
- The configuration file runs with the Phase_1 folder as the base project. Using the group_0011 folder or the phase1 
folder will require a different file path name.
- For the Trader class, proposedItems = items awaiting approval, wantToLend = lending list, and wantToBorrow = wishlist
- We have some pre-made users and items already in the configuration file. To
create a new user, you can sign up for an account and specify if you'd like to submit an admin request
or just be a normal trader. To login, use the login option at the main screen.
